# time-traveling-trousers

This repo has nothing to do with time traveling (well, not really, except maybe in an existential sense) and nothing to do with trousers. Definitely nothing to do with trousers, since I'm currently wearing jeans.

It's actually a javascript exercise, demonstrating a template engine using a fortune teller, but that would be a really long repo name.

Suggested sample data for cutting and pasting:

Data:
"subject" => "Gertrude", "object" => "cookies"
"subject" => "neighbors", "object" => "peace"
"adjective" => "shiny", "thing" => "dollars"


Strings:
Someday, ${subject} will give me ${object}
Ask ${subject} for ${object} and you will receive
Only ${subject} can take away ${object}
Soon you will receive ${adjective} ${thing}
